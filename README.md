# EmbryoTimecourse2018
This repo contains data and analysis scripts for our Embryo Timecourse paper. 
There are two types of content here: scripts to get the processed data (`download`), and scripts that we have used to do our analyses (`analysis_scripts`).

**The download script is very shortly to be added here: we are currently experiencing a bug on the server to host the data.**
